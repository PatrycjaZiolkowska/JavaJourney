# Java Journey Repository

Welcome to my Java practice repository! This repository contains my practice exercises with Java. I created this repository to keep track of my progress and share my code with others.

# Development Environment

I am using Visual Studio Code as my local repository to write and test my Java code. I am also using Git as my version control system to commit and push changes to this remote repository.

# Getting Started

To clone this repository to your local machine, run the following command:

* gh repo clone PatrycjaZiolkowska/JavaJourney
* git clone https://github.com/PatrycjaZiolkowska/JavaJourney.git

This command will create a local copy of your remote repository on your machine, allowing you to work on the code locally and make changes before pushing them back to the remote repository.

# Resources

* Java documentation
