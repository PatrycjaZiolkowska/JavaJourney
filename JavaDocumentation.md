I am using Java programming language, JDK (Java Development Kit) for compiling and running Java programs, and VSC (Visual Studio Code) as my code editor.

Download Links
* JDK: To download the JDK, you can go to the Oracle website at

VSC: VSC (Visual Studio Code) is a free, open-source code editor that you can download from the official website at https://code.visualstudio.com/Download.

Java Basics
* "public class {}" is the basic syntax used to define a class in Java.
* "public static void main(String[] args)": is the main method that runs when a Java program is executed. It is the entry point of the program and any code inside this method will be executed.
* Comparison Operators: These are operators used to compare values in Java. Some examples of comparison operators are "==", "!=", "<", ">", "<=", and ">=".
* Custom Scanner: A custom Scanner can be created in Java to read user input from the console. This is done by instantiating a new Scanner object and calling its methods to read user input.
* Math Operators: Java has several built-in math operators, including addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/), and modulus (%). These operators can be used to perform mathematical calculations in Java.
* Increment and Decrement: Java has two unary operators, "++" and "--", which can be used to increment and decrement variables by one, respectively. These operators can be used to simplify code and make it more readable.
* Logical Operators: Java has three logical operators, "&&" (AND), "||" (OR), and "!" (NOT), which can be used to combine multiple boolean expressions and evaluate their truth values.
* Conditional Statements "else if:" This is a conditional statement in Java that is used to test multiple conditions. It is used when you have more than two options to choose from
